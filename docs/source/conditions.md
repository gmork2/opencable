# Terms of Service

## Introduction

By signing up for _opencable_, you accept our Privacy Policy, 
so this Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.
We reserve the right to update these Terms of Service later.

### EEA Representative

If you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA), the Services are
provided by _opencable_, which for the purposes of applicable data protection legislation 
is the data controller responsible for your personal data when you use our Services.

## Legal Ground for Processing Your Personal Data

We process your personal data on the ground that such processing is necessary to further
our legitimate interests (including: (1) providing effective and innovative Services to
our users; and (2) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud or security issues in
respect of our provision of Services), unless those interests are overridden by your interest
or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.

## What Personal Data We Use

### Advanced features

We may use some aggregated data about how you use _opencable_ for error diagnostics and
performance measurements with the intention of improving your experience using our
application.

### No Ads Based on User Data

Unlike other services, we don't use your data for ad targeting or other commercial purposes.
_opencable_ only stores the information it needs to function as a secure search service.

## Use of the application by the user

The user agrees to be solely responsible for the use of the data obtained through this
application and that _opencable_ has no liability to him with respect to such uses and the
consequences thereof, including any damage or loss that he or third parties may suffer.
These terms only limit our liabilities as permitted by applicable law.

## Who Your Personal Data May Be Shared With

### Law Enforcement Authorities

If _opencable_ receives a court order confirming that you are suspected of terrorism, we can
release all the information we have, although until now, this has never happened.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We will review and may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes to this
Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting in the application itself. Please visit the
related sections frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Policy and
Terms of Use.

## Questions and concerns

If you have any questions about privacy and our data policies, please contact us
through the chat in the contact link, we will respond as soon as possible.
